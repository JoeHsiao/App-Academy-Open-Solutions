# App-Academy-Open-Solutions
These are my solutions to the practice projects from the [App Academy Open](https://my.appacademy.io/) course, while me going through it. The course focuses on full-stack software development techniques. At this moment, the material covers html, css, javascript, SQL, React, Redux, Python, and microservices.

## FAQ
### Do you cover all the projects?
No. I am still in the middle of the course and I am self-taught with a CS background, so I skipped the ones that are intuitive to me or being similar to another project.

### What if I can't find what I need?
You can join and ask questions in the App Academy Open [discord](https://discord.gg/UP6ekCcVc6).
